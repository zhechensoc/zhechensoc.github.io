I am a Ph.D. student at Duke University in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.duke.edu/) and an affiliated graduate student of the [Duke University Population Research Institute (DUPRI)](https://dupri.duke.edu/). 

My current research focuses on population health, aging, and health policy.
